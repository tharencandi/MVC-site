## Agendas

### Discuss Personas and Interviews 

**Presenters:** Tharen, Mariam\
**Action by:** Everyone

Expanding on the previous week, we collated our research material that came from a variety of sources including surveys and interviews, allowing us to create more accurate persona. We then discussed the consequences of our findings in relation to our design. Mariam created Lo-fi/rough wire frames on the board as the group agreed on needed changes. Tharen will iterate on these wireframes in Adobe XD in order to allow a consistent presentation and portable/shareable format. Both annotated the wireframes with justification for these design choices.

### Information Architecture
**Presenters:** Haeata, Chen, Hongjia\
**Action by:** Everyone

Discussed the results of our open and closed card sorting. Chen pointed out that while our main content categories were on par with the results of our open and closed card sorting, the more miscellaneous items such extra resources, guides for setup (i.e downloading and setup of text editor or ide) and social functionality were in many cases differing from what we expected. Haeata suggested that perhaps instead of having a seperate category for extra resouces, they should be a sub category of the topic that its content pertains to, while social functionality should be divided into content based channels. The group decided to perform card sorting again with these changes to test. Hongjia showed the group examples of good navigation side bars that allow for the ordered progression of the content and strong visibility of where the user is at any given point. The group agreed to pursue a similar format.

### Website Name and Color Scheme

**Presenters:** Haeata, Tharen, Mariam\
**Action by:** Everyone

Brain stormed name ideas. Everyone agreed that it needed to be simple, easy to recognise while retaining a sense of formality associated with good learning material. The group agreed to "Jerry" for the time being. Haeata and Tharen showed the group three online tools that can assist with color scheme selection and creation, https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/, https://coolors.co/palettes/trending. Mariam suggested a color palate which tharen quickly applied to a wireframe to evaluate. Haeata and Mariam thought it was good, Tharen was undecided and Chen and Hongjia didn't like it. Further research and testing is needed.

### Project Timeline
**Presenters:** Everyone\
**Action by:** Everyone

Discussed goals and milestones for the project to ensure required work is completed. Decided that a prototype design will have been completed by the end of Week 4, and the content of the website collated and edited. Similarly the group decided that by the end of week 4 everyone should have ensured they understood the basics of html,css and bottle to create rough prototype of the website that can be implemented in week 5 and iterated on.
