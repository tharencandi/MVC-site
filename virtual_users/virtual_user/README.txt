The run_vu.py is the engine of the virtual_users.
By python3 run_vu.py start running the virtual_users.

For running it locally, you need to change the driverpath
attribute of Virtual_user to the path of firefox driver
in Virtual_user.py. 

There are two modes for run_vu.py controlled by input,
one is running all virtual users, another is running one 
virtual user randomly.

Running all virtual users at once is not recommoned because the large
amount of virtual users take relatively long time and may cause unexpected
behaviour and result of the website.

For running vu_admin.py, it needs input from user
to login as admin. You need to ask us for username and password.
