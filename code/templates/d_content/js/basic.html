	<h1>Basic Syntax</h1>
	<div class="content-section content-text">
		<h3 class="subtitle">Comments</h3>

<p>
Comments are just as important in Javascript as in every other language. The syntax of comments is the same as in Java, C and and in many other languages:
</p>
<code class="language-javascript">// Comment on a single line </code>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">/* Comment over several lines <br>
 * Insert informative message here.<br>
 *
</code></pre>
<code class="language-javascript">/* No /* Nesting */ Like This */</code>



		<h3 class="subtitle">Variable Declerations</h3>
<p>
Three options to declare a variable:
</p>
<code class="language-javascript">var x = 1 <br> let y = 1 <br> const z = 1</code>
<p>
You should be using let and const, as var is no longer needed in almost all cases (It is has been replaced by the more modern let and const).
<br>

The "let" keyword declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
<br>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let a 
let x; 
x = "hello" 
</code></pre>
<p>
The const keyword declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. Note that const is like python properties of reference types i.e objects are not protected, only the name (reference)
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const h = "constant"</code></pre>

</p>
		<h3 class="subtitle">What is Variable Scope</h3>
<p>
When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Arithmatic and Logical Operators</h3> 
<p>
These operators are exactly the same as in Java. However, it is important to note that the == does not behave the same as in other languages. Instead === should be used.

<ul>
	<li> <b>Comparison Operators</b>
		<ul>
			<li> === strict equality: == behaves differently and should not be used.
			</li>
			<li> !== strict inequality. != behaves differently and should not be used.
			</li>
			<li>&lt;</li>
			<li>&gt;</li>
			<li>&lt;=</li>
			<li>&gt;=</li>

		</ul>

	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Arithmatic Operators</b>
		<ul>
			<li>+</li>
			<li>-</li>
			<li>*</li>
			<li>/</li>
			<li>%</li>
			<li>++</li>
			<li>--</li>
			<li>**</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> 
		<b>Logical Operators</b>
		<ul>
			<li>&#38;&#38;</li>
			<li>||</li>
			<li>!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
