CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that specifies how documents (HTML) are
presented and laid out to the users.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Syntax</h3>
<p>CSS is a rule based language, rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to either a particular element only or a group of elements on your webpage.<br>

This is a simple CSS rule that would apply background and text colour to the whole HTML document.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 { <br>
  color: cyan;<br>
  font-size: 25pt;<br>
}
</pre></code>
<p>
The rule starts with a selector. Based on the code block above, we are selecting the whole HTML document by selecting the <code class="language-html">h1</code> element on the first line.

The curly braces <code class="language-css">{ }</code> are used to indicate that you want to start or stop one or more <b>declarations</b> for the selected element. A declaration is made up of a <b>property</b> and <b>value</b> pair, separated by a colon <code class="language-css">:</code>. For example, line 2 is a declaration, with the property <code class="language-css">color</code> and value <code class="language-css">cyan</code>. The <code class="language-css">color</code> property is used to define the font colour inside the element selected. Finally, a semicolon <code class="language-css">;</code> is used to indicate that we have finished a declaration. You can do multiple declarations in one rule. On line 3, we set the property <code class="language-css">font-size</code>, which determines the font size in the element selected. <code class="language-css">25pt</code> is the value for this property. <code class="language-css">pt</code> stands for point, which is a unit. Some other units available are <code class="language-css">px</code>, <code class="language-css">cm</code>, <code class="language-css">em</code>, <code class="language-css">%</code> and more.
