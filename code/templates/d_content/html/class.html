		<h3 class="subtitle">HTML Classes</h3>

		<p>The attribute class usually outlines the class name in a style sheet, but it can also be used with javascript to modify elements within that class. Elements can be classified as a class to have common characteristics, this in terms of HTML, could mean a common font and colour of text.
 
The syntax for a class can be denoted as a (.) before the class name, then curly braces {}.
 such as
.city{
}
&lt;h2 class=&quot;city&quot;&gt;London&lt;/h2&gt;
 
HTML elements can be associated with multiple classes, by a space to separate the class names.

<div class="code">
.city{
}
.main{
}
&lt;h2 class=&quot;city main&quot;&gt;London&lt;/h2&gt;
</div>
As stated above, these classes can be used in Javascript to perform tasks, which can be accessed with getElementswithClassName().
</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">HTML ID's'</h3>
<p>HTML consists of an id attribute that creates a unique id for each element where there shouldn&rsquo;t be more than one element of the same id in a document. This attribute is used to specify a specific style declaration on the style sheet to use on that element. This can also be used to access that element in Javascript to use.
The syntax of an id is a hash followed by the name of the id such as (#myHeader).
<div class="code">
#myHeader {
}
&lt;h1 id=&quot;myHeader&quot;&gt;My Header&lt;/h1&gt;
</div>
 
As noticed above Ids and classes seem very similar in HTML&hellip;
The main difference between an id and class is that classes can be used for several elements but an id can only be used by one element in that document.
